x is a square invertible matrix
retrun = a list containing functions to set the matrix, get the matrix,
set the inverse, get the inverse
this list is used as the input to cachSolve()
## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse
}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
